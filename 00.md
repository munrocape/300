## Write a thesis statement taking a position on when the state surveillance of private emails is appropriate. Give three supporting claims.


There are three parts of a thesis:

1. Clear (limited) position: State surveilance of emails in never appropriate 
2. Emphasis: An electronic mail is only different from regular mail in that it is virtual. We do not allow surveillanc of mail contents and we should not allow the snooping of email.
3. Methodology: By exploring the degredation of civil liberties in regeimes that spied on email as well as the diminishing returns that spying on email has - it is not the only way for nefarious peope to communicate - it will be clear that this is insufficient to stop criminal activity.
