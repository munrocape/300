## Explain Eric Raymondâ€™s metaphors of the Cathedral and the Bazaar. How do these metaphors relate to open source coding? What was the central argument in his essay?

Give an example of a Cathedral
- Example: Windows, Mac OS X
Give an example of a bazaar
- Example: Linux, Ubuntu
Cathedral: code built by a small group of well-established and accomplished programmers with no beta releases
Bazaar: coding that is a combined effort of many, many individuals from different backgrounds and approaches

Raymond's central argument is that the bazaar style of coding encourages rapid development in the software industry, as it is the work of a collective that is constantly evolving and learning from itself. He maintains that it is a worthwhile approach due to the sheer volume of individuals that can work to overcome bugs and other problems. The cathedral style is still viable, but it lacks the grand peer-to-peer review that the bazaar grants.

## The Linux team evolved a new way for software development teams to work together. Their process allowed many individuals and teams all over the world to contribute code to Linux, gated by a much smaller team of maintainers. What were the social, source code control system, and testing changes they came up with? 

Social changes: with many eyes, all bugs are shallow
  - many teams working on features; no hierarchical management
  - creation of new kinds of communities; however, not always positive collaboration (github and gerrit: abrasive commentary during reviews)
  - Linux proved that open source works; since its widespread success, more companies and even other sectors (arts, education, health) have been exploring its possibilities
Source code control system changes: git, created ~2005 after a falling out with Bitkeeper
  - intended for distributed teams
  - really good at managing branches, really good rebase support
Testing changes:
  - git eliminated the use of patches as separate diff files; patches were instead first class objects

## How does awareness of the source code help both the developers and the testers of the same software?

- An awareness of the source code helps the developers of the software because they are working from it in order to create software
- It also helps testers because in order to know the context they're working in

## How can frequent merging of patches or other updates with the mainline development of open source code help testers locate and fix a bug?

Frequent merging of patches or updates with the mainline helps testers locate and fix bugs because the open source is continually being updated on a day to day basis rather than monthly; testers will always be up to date with the open source code rather than working on an outdated version
