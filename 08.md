## Explain Eric Raymondâ€™s metaphors of the Cathedral and the Bazaar. How do these metaphors relate to open source coding? What was the central argument in his essay?

- Give an example of a Cathedral
- Example: Windows, Mac OS X
- Give an example of a bazaar
- Example: Linux, Ubuntu
- The metaphor of the cathedral is reflective of a type of coding that is built by a small group of well-established and accomplished programmers with no beta releases. The metaphor of the bazaar on the other hand, reflects coding that is a combined effort of many, many individuals from different backgrounds and approaches.
- Raymond's central argument is that the bazaar style of coding encourages rapid development in the software industry, as it is the work of a collective that is constantly evolving and learning from itself. He maintains that it is a worthwhile approach due to the sheer volume of individuals that can work to overcome bugs and other problems. The cathedral style is still viable, but it lacks the grand peer-to-peer review that the bazaar grants. Cathedrals cannot compete with the speed of the bazaar.

## The Linux team evolved a new way for software development teams to work together. Their process allowed many individuals and teams all over the world to contribute code to Linux, gated by a much smaller team of maintainers. What were the social, source code control system, and testing changes they came up with? 

Social changes: with many eyes, all bugs are shallow
  - many teams working on features; no hierarchical management
  - everyone can see the changes to the mainline (trunk); goal of teams are to merge their "branches" to the trunk
  - each branch follows these steps of distributed development: rebase/review/merge: rebase code in updated linux sources, prepare and review patch for your work, then merge the patch with the mainline
  - creation of new kinds of communities; however, not always positive collaboration (github and gerrit: abrasive commentary during reviews)
  - Linux proved that open source works; since its widespread success, more companies and even other sectors (arts, education, health) have been exploring its possibilities
Source code control system changes: git, created ~2005 after a falling out with Bitkeeper
  - intended for distributed teams
  - really good at managing branches, really good rebase support
Testing changes:
  - git eliminated the use of patches as separate diff files; patches were instead first class objects

## How does awareness of the source code help both the developers and the testers of the same software?

- An awareness of the source code helps the developers of the software because they are working from it in order to create software; they know what their code can do, and so they know what to do with it.
- It also helps testers because in order to know the parameters they're working with, they need to know the source code in order to be able to point out specific errors or improvements that need to be made with context.

## How can frequent merging of patches or other updates with the mainline development of open source code help testers locate and fix a bug?

Frequent merging of patches or updates with the mainline helps testers locate and fix bugs because the open source is continually being updated on a day to day basis rather than monthly; thus testers will always be up to date with the open source code rather than working on an outdated version for a long period of time, and then having to restructure/rewrite if any changes were made.
