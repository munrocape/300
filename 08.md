## Explain Eric Raymondâ€™s metaphors of the Cathedral and the Bazaar. How do these metaphors relate to open source coding? What was the central argument in his essay?

- Give an example of a Cathedral
- Example: Windows, Mac OS X
- Give an example of a bazaar
- Example: Linux, Ubuntu
- The metaphor of the cathedral is reflective of a type of coding that is built by a small group of well-established and accomplished programmers with no beta releases. The metaphor of the bazaar on the other hand, reflects coding that is a combined effort of many, many individuals from different backgrounds and approaches.
- Raymond's central argument is that the bazaar style of coding encourages rapid development in the software industry, as it is the work of a collective that is constantly evolving and learning from itself. He maintains that it is a worthwhile approach due to the sheer volume of individuals that can work to overcome bugs and other problems. The cathedral style is still viable, but it lacks the grand peer-to-peer review that the bazaar grants.

## The Linux team evolved a new way for software development teams to work together. Their process allowed many individuals and teams all over the world to contribute code to Linux, gated by a much smaller team of maintainers. What were the social, source code control system, and testing changes they came up with?

## How does awareness of the source code help both the developers and the testers of the same software?

- An awareness of the source code helps the developers of the software because they are working from the source code in order to create software
- It also helps testers because in order to know the parameters they're working with, they need to know the source code in order to be able to point out specific errors or improvements that need to be made

## How can frequent merging of patches or other updates with the mainline development of open source code help testers locate and fix a bug?
