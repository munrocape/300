## Use a veil of ignorance argument to explain why the following situation is an ethical set-up or not an ethical set-up: a society where everyone is either a serf (living in poverty) or a noble-person (living with wealth).

This isn't ethical since it creates a situation in which half of the society's individuals are suffering, which through the veil of ignorance contradicts the moral standpoint that each decision is made for the betterment of the whole of society, rather than for the comfort of part of the population.

## What is stereotype threat? Explain with at least two examples.

- Stereotype threat is when people underperform (on tests, in competitions, etc.) in response to an awareness of stereotypes about their demographic group.
- Example 1: Underperformance of individuals from ethnic/racial groups that are negatively stereotyped concerning intelligence
- Example 2: Underperformance of women in STEM fields when there are constant reminders of gender-differences

## What is the difference between equity and equality? Explain using examples.

Equality is when everyone is given the same treatment
Equity is when everyone is given the amount of treatment they need to be on even ground with everyone else

Example: Three people are watching a baseball game from behind a fence. One person is tall, one person is average height, and another is short.
The tall person can see the game clearly, while the view of the person of average height is just barely obstructed by the fence. The shortest person cannot see the game at all. When they are all given a box of the same height dimension to stand on (equality), the tall person is still able to see the game, and the view of the person of average height is now completely unobstructed. However, the shortest individual is still unable to see the game.
However, since the tall person can already see the game very well, when we give the person of average height and the shortest individual a box suited to their heights (equity) in relation to the fence, then everyone can see the game clearly.

## Women are underrepresented in technology. Men are underrepresented in elementary school teaching. Much effort is being put towards correcting these situations. But no definitive strategy is universally considered to be the most effective. Give a thesis statement that takes a position on some aspect of this situation (e.g., concerning affirmative action, how parallel these situations really are, how it relates to similar situations with minority groups,  etc.)

Possible approaches:

Concerning affirmative action: Affirmative action attempts to eliminate socially-imposed boundaries
- encourages an individual's interests rather than imposing pre-conceptions
- creates more opportunities for those whose gender is less common in these fields
- decreased chance of bias confirmation if more balance is achieved

Parallel situations: Stereotypes encourage and maintain imbalances in different fields of employment
- pre-conception that women are more suited to the hospitality and care sector
- pre-conception that men are less emotional, making them unsuitable for hospitality and care work

Relation to situations concerning minority groups: Underrepresentation of minority groups in higher-ranking or higher paying fields
- Latin-Americans are underrepresented in high-paying industries such as business, financial activities, education and health services
- disproportionate representation of Asian individuals in upper management and board positions in the Silicon Valley software industry, despite high amounts of representation in the field overall
