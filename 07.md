## How do the rights of ownership of a chair that you bought differ from the rights of ownership over a computer game that you made? 

- Ownership of a chair entitles you to that physical chair only
- Ownership of a computer game you made is a bit more complex, since there's no physical property to it

## What is fair use? Give an example of fair use of copyrighted material. 

- Fair use is when you use brief excerpts of a given work - this action should have little impact on the value of the work
- Example: Using a short section of a textbook as a reading for a university course

## Why did Bill Gates encourage his employees to file as many patents as possible? Make reference to software patenting, cross-licensing, and the arms race metaphor.

## What is different about a software patent and a patent for a mechanical invention? Why might it be difficult to know if software you have written is infringing on a patent held by somebody else?

- A patent for a mechanical invention differs from that of a software patent because the former is specific about physical forms and materials. A software patent is patenting an abstract, non-physical thing that relies on source code (which is concerned a trade secret, so it's private) - you would never be able to know whether your source code was similar to that of another patented software.

## Oracle recently sued Google for violating its intellectual property rights over Google’s implementation of Java in Android. Explain why Google’s claim that Android was a “white room” implementation was relevant. Describe how certain files Oracle located in the (open) Android sources undermined Google’s claim. 



## Oracle contends that when Google implemented various Java APIs in Android it violated Oracle’s copyrights. Explain why this is a threat to Android. Explain why this worries many players in the software industry.



## If someone holds the intellectual property rights to something  that you want to use, how can you gain the legal right to do so? Refer to each of the four types of intellectual property.
