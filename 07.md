## Compare and contrast the five types of intellectual property. In each case describe how the rights to the holder are balanced by benefits to society.

1. Trade Secret: keeping something private so it doesn't get copied; this is good for ip or code for certain periods of time (no leaking), but not ideal for media that is usually widely distributed and shared in order to make profit (movies, music, etc); this allows the holder to maintain their "edge", so to speak, and further the development of their product
2. Trademark: a name that only the owner can use; protects customers from buying fake goods and allows a company to build their brand (almost to a point that the name becomes part of common language; in which case the owner loses rights to exclusive use)
3. Patent: detailed description of invention, supposedly enough so that anyone could replicate it (available for public use, thus allowing society to benefit in the long run); in return for full disclosure, the inventor gets exclusive use of the invention and its patent for a limited period of time (in which afterwards anyone can use it)
3. Industrial Design or Design Patent (USA): protects the shape, colour or design of a product; similar to the trademark in that it protects from the purchase of fake goods and allows company to build a brand based off of product aesthetic; can be a tad regressive, seeing as there are only so many ways that a specific kind of product can be designed for practical use (i.e. iPhone design)
4. Copyright: Five rights (see below): is supposed to allow for the same kind of protection that a patent provides, but has regressed into copyright hoarding (constant copyright renewal which restricts creative development of the copyrighted idea, object, etc)

## What are the five rights of a copyright holder?

For 95 years:
1. Reproduce
2. Distribute copies to the public
3. Display copies in public
4. Perform in public
5. Produce new works derived from the original

## How do the rights of ownership of a chair that you bought differ from the rights of ownership over a computer game that you made? 

- Ownership of a chair entitles you to the physical chair; also possession is nine/tenths of the law, especially for physical items
- Ownership of a computer game you made is a bit more complex, since there's no physical property to it; you own the source code, and while the game isn't published you may also have the rights to trade secrets so the game and its code do not get leaked. Once distributed, you may have a trademark on the title, a design patent for the cover art, and a copyright in order to distribute your work so it makes it illegal for people to distribute your work for free (if you charged for it) or claim ownership; however, once it is in the possession of another individual (i.e. downloaded, owned on a CD) there's not much you can do personally if they decide to infringe on all of the safeguards you implemented

## What is fair use? Give an example of fair use of copyrighted material. 

- Fair use is when you use brief excerpts of a given work - this action should have little impact on the value of the work
- Example: Using a short section of a textbook as a reading for a university course

## Why did Bill Gates encourage his employees to file as many patents as possible? Make reference to software patenting, cross-licensing, and the arms race metaphor.

- Patents are more valuable than a physical object: once you have the patents, not only can you make whatever is specified by the patent, but you can charge other people who want to make something similar to what you have patented
- Example: Google and its acquisition of Motorola
  - Motorola wasn't valuable for its physical assets (phones, handsets); they bought it for $12.5 billion, kept the mobile patents and then sold the rest to Lenovo for $2.91 billion - the patents were valued at $5.5 billion to Google
- Cross-licensing allows a company to access another's patents in exchange for access into their patents; Google's acquisition of Motorola may have allowed them to make cross-licensing deals with Samsung
- Arms race metaphor: everyone gets as many patents as possible so they are on even playing field - in preparation for constant lawsuits against each other, such as the eternal feud between Apple and Google

## What is different about a software patent and a patent for a mechanical invention? Why might it be difficult to know if software you have written is infringing on a patent held by somebody else?

- As mentioned in the Quinn reading, patents filed for mechanical inventions are compared to those already issued to determine the existing technical knowledge (prior art). However, this doesn't work well for software patents, because a significant amount of software was written before software patents were first granted. And so the question becomes who has rights to the patent - the holder, the challenger, or neither.

## Oracle recently sued Google for violating its intellectual property rights over Google’s implementation of Java in Android. Explain why Google’s claim that Android was a “white room” implementation was relevant. Describe how certain files Oracle located in the (open) Android sources undermined Google’s claim. 

Google's claim that Android was a "white room" implementation makes Oracle's claim less effective in claiming copyright infringement - since created in a situation where the code was essentially copied through reverse engineering according to API specification, and thus any similarities would be deemed coincedental. However Oracle countered with copyright claims to the API, searching through Android's code looking for similarities in API implementations.

## Oracle contends that when Google implemented various Java APIs in Android it violated Oracle’s copyrights. Explain why this is a threat to Android. Explain why this worries many players in the software industry.

This is a threat to Android because if Oracle gets its way, then Android cannot use the Java APIs that are in use right now unless they pay Oracle or, as per the five rights of copyright, give the Android OS to Oracle as it legally owns any intellectual property created from their "original work" (the Java APIs). This is dangerous for the software industry because the extent of fair use of an API can be contested by the owner, thus making it more difficult to gauge the extent to which software is allowed to have similarities even through "white room" implementation.

## If someone holds the intellectual property rights to something that you want to use, how can you gain the legal right to do so? Refer to each of the four types of intellectual property.

1. Trade secrets: Ask nicely, strike a deal or buy the company
2. Trademark: "Rent" rights to use the trademark, or merge companies
3. Patents/Design Patents: Pay the holder, license or cross-license agreements
4. Copyright: Ask nicely, offer money or free esposure/advertising (be advised that doesn't work that often in tech)
