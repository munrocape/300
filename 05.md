## What do we mean by the term “industrial revolution”? We described several periods of time in which technological innovations disrupted society. Give specific examples and explain them.

Big boom in productivity as a result of industry. Disruptive machines created.
Example:
1st wave: Spinning Jenny (loom)
2nd: Steam engine
(Now) 3rd: Advanced robotics

## What is the Solow Paradox? Give two hypotheses to explain the apparent paradox.

Productivity growth lags behind tech innovation. This is measured by tech increases related to GDP.
1. People get distracted by technology
2. OR personal productivity for some is up, but middle income jobs destroyed so GDP/head has not risen
Perhaps wealth is being hoarded by those that control the purse strings (it is).
This is a destabalizing force.

## What is the Luddite fallacy? In class we discussed why current worries concerning predicted advancements soon to be made in AI sound similar to those raised by the Luddites in previous industrial revolutions.

People got scared about looms. Went crazy / destroyed the machines. However, looms increased productivity, made people overall richer / happier.
National savings / growth == stock of capital / national income
If growth rate goes low, stock / income rate booms.

## The French economist Thomas Piketty pointed out what trend in income distribution over the last century? Give a significant reason why one might worry about Piketty’s predictions.

Piketty noted that it took major market corrections (Great Depression, Black Monday) to sort out income distribution. We are mirroring the same trends.

## Manufacturing is a powerful economic force. However, it plays a different role in the growth of emerging economies today than even 20 years ago.  How did this happen and why is it less likely to happen in the future? Hint: contract Korea and Pakistan.

Low wages -> competitive production -> easy exports -> not the same supply chain capablities of using manufacturing to bring yourself up as an emerging market as before.
Much easier to pick up shop and move to another country for production. "Premature de-industrialization"

## Agree or disagree with the following statement: “The middle class is disappearing.” Explain your position with reference to present software technology and anticipated innovations in AI.

Yes. Inflation is still occuring, banks are sitting on loans, new wealth generated is being kept at the top. 
AI will eat trucking - a large source of stability for many on the bubble. Will whatever company that develops the algos want to just subsidize wages?
Rich will be _ultra_ rich. New means of social welfare / structure will need to be created.
