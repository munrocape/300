## For each of the following pieces of advice, name the speaker, explain what they mean, and state why the speaker thinks  it is important advice.

##### “Computing isn’t about computers anymore. It is about living.” - Negroponte

Computing powers so much more than just computers. Social interactions, economies, medical research, it is deeply engrained in our lives.

##### “The future of television is to stop thinking of television as television.” - Negroponte

Negroponte switch.

We _consume_ media through televisions. Devices that we use should be personal/mobile/interactive.

(i think this is right)

##### “Demo or die” - Negroponte

Before, you had to demonstrate your concept - in the form of a demo - to validate it to yours peers (and the people sigining your checks). If you are unable to demo, you will _die_ in the industry you work in.

##### “Deploy or die” - Ito

Ito expanded on this to deploy or die - if you are not deploying your idea, and validating it wihtin a larger market, you shall "die".

##### “Power of pull” - Ito

As our networks expand, the power that we can derive from them increases. You can get great benefit/working groups form the internet. Like those guys who were working on radiation detection globally for Japan.

##### “Learning over education” - Ito

Education is what people do to you and learning is what you do for yourself.

Learning is self driven/motivated. Probably more applicable to what you are actually interested in. Leverage "power of pull" over reactive education environments.

##### “Compass over maps” - Ito

Better to teach people how to navigate then tell them where to go.

Furthermore, the cost of mapping an ever expanding/changing world is difficult.
