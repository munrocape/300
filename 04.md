## Describe one of the scenarios from the ACM ethics handouts and explain who acted ethically and who acted unethically according to the code, making reference to specific statements in the ACM code of ethics.

> LOOK AT THE ACM DOC

## What was the rationale for why a profession like medicine, the law, or engineering should govern itself?

They know what's best for their profession, and what standards that those part of their professions should be held to.

## Currently, how is the software profession different from engineering and medicine? Make reference to professional colleges, legal protection, public perception, and other concepts discussed in class.

You can build and sell rocketship software - no questions asked.
A bachelor's in computer science is about as valuable as a receipt from an ACM coding boot camp.
You can't open up a medical clinic - there's a lot of rules and regulations that these other professions have put in place in order to give them more accountability.
As a software developer, you can't be legally held accountable for mistakes, and you don't have to follow a specific code of ethics either (unlike doctors or engineers.)
Damage/impact can be equated.
However much they can be equated, the public doesn't seem to think too much about the implications of rocketship software being built and sold by just anyone. That might be due to the notion that software is far too abstract and non-physical to hurt anything, but it's just as effective as any other profession in doing damage (or doing something worthwhile for society.)

## How would the existence of a code of ethics help the computer industry?

It would help to shore up legally grey areas.

Furthermore, it could pressure proper standards and practices around things like data privacy as well as general security. We establish sanitary practices in doctor's operating rooms while none exist for even governments who handle terabytes of personal information.

(Maybe link this to a negroponte / ito quote) We now live in an age where technology is more and more important - like medical capablities. We need to advance our code of ethics and establish it.
