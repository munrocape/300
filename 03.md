## What is meant by the phrase of “cost-benefit analysis”?

An appraisal or analysis of a project aimed at weighing the benefits versus the costs. It is a systematic approach that aims to analyze net welfare ("greatest good for the greatest number") from a utilitarian perspective. This means quantifying all outcomes/consequences and determining which decisions will lead to the greatest net benefit.

## What is utilitarianism and how can you use it to make decisions?

Utilitarianism aims to maximize "utility", which essentially means it looks to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of people (Jeremy Bentham). As a result, this field of Ethics considers that only the consequences of an action are important. Therefore, any action is useful if it aims to maximize utility. Se you make decisions based on this.

## What is social contract theory, and how can you use it to make decisions?

The general idea of social contract theory is that we, as people, enter into a contract (either explicitly or tacitly) which requires us to sacrifice some of our rights in order to ensure protection of the rest of them.

e.g. "I give up my right to take other people's things so that other people will not take my things."

This is a silly example, but gives a good general grasp of a basic "social contract" most of us are engaged in.

Basically, most of us follow the rules most of the time because it is in our mutual best interest. We are free to follow our own path as long as we don't disrupt the social contract.

## Discuss the dictum “The ends justifies the means” in the light of Utilitarianism.

As we know, Utilitarianism aims to maximize utility; therefore, when a decision is made the only things that matters are the consequences and not the "morality" of the act itself. The mantra of "the ends justifies the means" comes into play because the "mean" could be deemed wrong by other branches of ethics, yet is still the choice that maximizes utility and thus is the "right choice" by Utilitarianism's structure.

The obvious example here is "If killing one man could save thousands more, killing that one man maximizes utility and thus is the right choice to make." Here the "end" (thousands of people are saved - a 'good' outcome) justifies the "means" (you killed a man - a 'wrong' decision according to virtue ethics)
